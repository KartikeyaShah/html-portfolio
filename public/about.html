<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Yo frfr, I woke up feelin like a whole vibe, no cap. Skrrtin' through my FYP, saw a baddie flexin’ drip so clean it had me deadass shook. Gave it a lil riz in the comments like “ur the main character fr,” now I'm just manifestin’ that mutual. Vibes immaculate, but the groupchat stay dry—lowkey a red flag but issa whatever. TBH, I’m just tryna live rent-free in someone’s mind while gaslighting myself into productivity.</p>

<p>Next thing you know, I’m ghostin’ reality, full-on delulu mode. Got the audacity to think I’m him, even though my bank account lookin like it got jump-scared. Caught an ick mid-scroll but still thirst-trappin for the aesthetic. Brain got more tabs open than Safari and none of 'em hittin. Just me, my situationship playlist, and vibes sponsored by emotional damage. LMK if anyone else feelin main character syndrome or if I’m just bein extra.</p>

<p>Lowkey started soft-launching my mental breakdown on close friends, tryna romanticize the chaos. Daydreamin’ about soft boys and iced lattes while hard-launching my flop era. Gave up on bein mysterious, now I overshare like it’s a side quest. Bruh energy strong, but so is the cringe. Life’s a loop of “I’m fine” and crying in my drafts. Highkey? Still vibin.</p>
